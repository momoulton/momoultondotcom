        <li>A “<a href="http://www.historytoday.com/history-today/books-year" target='_blank'>Book of the Year</a>,” History Today Vol. 64 12 December 2014</li>
        <li>"Thought-provoking, richly evidenced and superbly structured, Moulton’s book is a tour de force, and a compelling argument for studying Irish and British history together." (<a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/ireland-and-the-irish-in-interwar-england-by-mo-moulton/2014093.article" target='_blank'>Niamh Gallagher, "Ireland and the Irish in Interwar England by Mo Moulton," Times Higher Education 26 June 2014</a>)</li>
        <li>"A superb new book focusing on people often excluded from the Irish historical narrative." (<a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/entangled-connections-ireland-and-the-irish-in-interwar-england-1.1888307" target='_blank'>Enda Delaney, "Entangled connections: Ireland and the Irish in Interwar England," Irish Times 9 August 2014.</a>)</li>
        <li>"From sabotage campaigns to social clubs, and the misguided, over-romanticised notions of Ireland expounded in the English literary imagination, Moulton's book is a captivating, informative twinning and unravelling of those aspects of social history which our two very separate (yet perpetually intermingling) nations shared between the wars." (<a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/momoulton/files/bolger_mail_on_sunday_review.pdf" target='_blank'>Dermot Bolger, “Separate and Together,” Irish Mail on Sunday 14 September 2014</a>)</li>
        <li>"Harvard historian Mo Moulton’s wonderful first book, Ireland and the Irish in Interwar England relies on a number of unfamiliar and fascinating archival sources and reveals a complex set of attitudes towards Ireland and Irishness in England during the 1920s and 1930s. One of the many things the book does well is to highlight how the political concerns outlined by Ukip are nothing new. It would be salutary for figures like Daniel Hannon and Mark Reckless to read this volume, since Moulton points out that, during the 1930s depression era, the benefits-scrounging migrant-bogeyman of the English imagination was often an Irishman." (<a href="http://www.drb.ie/essays/enemies-within" target='_blank'>James Moran, "Enemies Within," Dublin Review of Books Issue 63: January 2015</a>)</li>
        <li>"Ireland was a problem, Moulton convincingly argues, that required a continual effort of repression." (<a href="http://www.historytoday.com/reviews/ireland-and-irish-interwar-england" target='_blank'>Lucy Delap, "Ireland and the Irish in Interwar England," History Today Vol 65 Issue 3, March 2015</a>)</li>
        <li>"Most histories of Anglo-Irish relations during this period have concentrated on high politics and government papers. Moulton gives us descriptions of Gaelic League dances, letters written home by British troops serving in Ireland during the Anglo-Irish war, meetings of the Irish Literary Society and accounts of St. Patrick's Day celebrations in inter-war England. But politics is not absent--especially in the period 1914-1921."
